A Python client for querying How Long To Beat

# Overview

I've wanted to create my own Python library for a while as practice and How Long To Beat is something I query as part of my site. I figure I could just create a Python library that interacts with the service, both for logged in and public actions.

You shouldn't reference this in any way as an example of good design because it's all experimental and I don't know what I'm doing.

It's still a work in progress so it's not at a usable state yet.
